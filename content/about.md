#### Hi There ! Thank you for visiting my page.

About me ? Hmm let's say I'm **curious**. Very curious. This curiosity drove me towards **science**. 

My main research topic is **Machine-Learning**. Once I started looking into it, I had no choice but to go deeper. There are so many possibilities and so many areas that could benefit from this knowledge !

I've also done a fair bit of **Micro-Services** research with the Latitude UnB research group! What we are creating is remarkable, but I can't go in details yet.

Besides all that, I Love **Open Source** development. Since 2016 I've been participating in Digital Ocean's **Hacktoberfest** every year. My two main programming languages are **Golang** and **Python**. I do fancy taking advantage of the Golang's better performance when it's reasonable, but Python is very useful (and it's **the thing** in ML). Wanna check some of what I do? Do check my [GitHub Page](http://github.com/auyer)!
